For week 3, we've set up our web server, created our UI, and gotten our temperature sensor to publish temperature data.
For the next two days, we need to actually update the UI with the temperature, turn on the UI light and enable
the UI to give us some sort of notification on our server when the temperature read by the sensor passes
a certain threshold.
